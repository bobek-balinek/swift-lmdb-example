# Swift + LMDB Example

## Synopsis

This is the simplest project to test waters with Kitura, [IBM's](Kitura.io) Swift server project and [LMDB](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/) a super-fast key/value store.

## Usage

Clone the repo and run `swift build` command from the project's directory. Swift Package Manager will clone all the dependencies and build an executable in `.build/debug` directory.

When done simply run `.build/debug/swift-lmdb-example`.

## Notes

This isn't a production-ready code, merely a proof of concept.
